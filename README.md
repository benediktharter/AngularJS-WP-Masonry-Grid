# AngularJS-WP-Masonry-Grid

AngularJS Masonry grid portfolio page using Wordpress as CMS with WP-JSON API


About
==========
I wanted to learn Angular, and needed to revamp my 5 year old online personal portfolio website.  This is a simple one page AngularJS website that pulls posts with the "portfolio" category form Wordpress using the WP-JSON API.


Technologies
------------
**AngularJS**

**Wordpress** - for easy customization and responsive design

**JSON API** - Required plugin for REST API

**Masonry** - JavaScript grid layout library

**FontAwesome** - Fonts for icons


Install Instructions
=====================
+ Download / Pull All Files
* Install Wordpress in your root directory in a folder called wordpress
+ Download/Instal/Activate the [JSON API WordPress Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/) by Ryan McCue
+ FTP to your root directory and add repo files
+ Add posts with category "portfolio", add images to your post and set featured image.
+ Come back and fork me

Install Instructions
=====================
Because WordPress is simply being used to serve the data, we can put WordPress into its own folder and keep our app files outside of that, in the root.
